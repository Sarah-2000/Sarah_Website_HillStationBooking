<center><h1>INFORMATION FOR VISITORS(TRAVEL OPTIONS):</h1>
<h2>By Air:
The nearest airport is at Bhuntar, located approximately 50 kilometres away from Manali. 
Domestic flights connect Bhuntar with Delhi and Chandigarh. 
Once at the airport, you can take a pre-paid taxi to Manali. 
However, owing to weather conditions, flights are not the most reliable option for getting to or out of Manali.


By Bus:
Manali is very well-connected to important tourist destinations like Leh, Shimla, Kullu, Dharamshala and New Delhi by means of a network of state-run as well as private buses. 
The bus journey from Delhi to Manali is 550 kilometres.
It is advisable to book your tickets in the air-conditioned Volvo coaches, as the buses are more comfortable than ordinary ones, keeping in mind the long distance of the journey.
There are 2-3 buses per day between Naggar and Jana village. 
The first bus from Naggar departs at 8:30 AM. Otherwise you can take a private taxi from Naggar.
Timings: 6 am - 6 pm on all days.

Road/Self Drive:
The drive up to Manali is simply breathtaking! 
You can catch scenic glimpses of the adjoining mountains and valleys from almost every turn that the twisty uphill road throws you in. 
Though a lot of tourists prefer a self-drive up to Manali, it is advisable to hire a taxi in case you are not comfortable with driving in mountainous regions.</h2>

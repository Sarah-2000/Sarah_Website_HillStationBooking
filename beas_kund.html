<center><h2>BEAS KUND:</h2></center>
<center><h3>Beas Kund is a high altitude alpine lake that sits royally amidst the mountains of Himachal Pradesh at an altitude of 3,700 meters. 
This taintless beauty is the origin of Beas River, which is believed to be the water body where Sage Vyas use to take bath while he meditated. 
Beas Kund Trek starts from Solang Nallah which is a popular destination in Manali for skiing and paragliding. 
Mesmerizing meadows of Dhundi and Bakarthach will be a part of your trail on Beas Kund Trek.
Majestic peaks like Hanuman Tibba, Friendship Peak, Shitidhar, and Seven Sisters will be your companion on this trek. 
One will also come across the Beas Kund Glacier while advancing towards Beas Kund. 
Pluck the wild strawberries and mushrooms on your way and lazily watch the herds of sheep and goats grazing. 
This summer trek is a perfect choice for the beginners because of its short duration and easy difficulty level.</h3></center>

<center><h2>JANA WATERFALL:</h2></center>
<center><h3>At a distance of 32 km from Manali Bus Stand, 33.5 km from Kullu Bus Stand and 12 km from Naggar, Jana Falls is a beautiful natural waterfall inside a small village known as Jana.
The Jana Falls is surrounded by deodar trees, pine trees, apple orchards and spectacular snow-covered mountain peaks.
This fall is a charming picnic spot.
The first sight of the falls is quite hidden and will be a surprise for the visitor as the water unexpectedly rushes from a cluster of rocks overlooking a wooden bridge.
You can also enjoy a refreshing bath at this falls or you can even leisurely swim in the small pool of this falls.
One can trek up the hill to reach the top of the hill which provides a better view of the waterfall and its lovely surroundings.
The short trek up the hill is fairly easy.
The falls can also be reached by a short drive from Naggar. 
After reaching the location one has to trek for about 10-15 minutes from nearest road point. 
The road towards Jana waterfalls is breathtaking beautiful.
September to June is ideal time to visit to this falls.</center>

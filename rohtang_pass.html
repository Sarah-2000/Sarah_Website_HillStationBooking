<center><h3>
When planning a trip to Manali, a day off to the vista point of Rohtang Pass is the ultimate and almost essential attraction of the itinerary.
Located at a distance of just 51 kilometres from the main town, Rohtang Pass can be reached only by road. 
The pass is located at a massive height of 3978 metres, the way up the hills is a treat to the eyes. 
As the vehicle climbs higher on the Manali- Keylong road, the beauty of the landscape around will leave you awestruck.
A peculiar fact behind the name of the place is that it was named so because a number of people working in CBRE died whilst trying to cross this treacherous stretch.
Owing to its splendid natural beauty, Rohtang Pass is a favourite among the community of film directors. Many blockbusters ranging from 'Jab We Met' to 'Yeh Jawani Hai Deewani' have been shot here. 
To just curl up on your seat in the car as it begins to chill with every increasing metre on the altitude scale and gaze outside at the mesmerizing beauty of nature is absolute bliss.
Rohtang pass is an experience of nature in one of its rawest forms possible, amongst mountain peaks covered with snow, breathtaking view and magnificent and sprawling landscapes and views.
The magnificence of the white landscape and sonorous silence is a mesmerising thing worth experiencing.

The Cider is a serene wooden chalet set in the famous apple orchards of Burwa valley, Manali. 
Overlooking the river Beas, this beautiful boutique retreat commands magnificent 360 degree views of the snow capped Himalayas from each of its rooms. 
Guests can revel in the quiet serenity of the hotel grounds, go for walks/picnics in the countryside, curl up with a book from our library, relax on a bench by the river or in a hammock under the apple trees. 
The panoramic views and natural beauty surrounding the retreat is sure to refresh your mind and soul. 
Sight-seeing, trekking and adventure activities and cabs are organized on request. 
Evenings can be spent around a cozy bonfire with yummy eats and foot-tapping music on our lawns. 
Chai in the Sky - our Garden Cafe and Restaurant serves delicious Indian, Chinese, Italian and local cuisine. 
We assure you a lifetime of memories of an enchanted holiday at The Cider!
